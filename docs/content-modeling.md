# Content modeling

## Collections

A **collection** is a content type (`pages`, `articles`, `products`).
Settings:

- `route` — public URL of entries. Type a prefix (`blog` → `/blog/{slug}`),
  a full pattern (`/news/{slug}`) or `/` for the site root; empty follows
  the handle (`/{handle}/{slug}`). Each collection needs its own.
- `icon` — sidebar icon in the admin.
- `archive_route` — archive URL when `has_archive` is on.
- `has_single`, `has_archive` — toggle detail/archive pages.
- `hierarchical` — entries can have a parent entry (see
  [Parent pages](#parent-pages)).
- `translatable`, `sluggable`, `dated`, `archivable`.
- `per_page` — archive pagination size.
- `template` — default Blade view for singles.
- `taxonomies` — attached taxonomy ids.

## Blueprints and fieldsets

**Blueprints** define the editable fields of a collection, taxonomy,
global or template part. **Fieldsets** are reusable groups of fields
included inside blueprints via a `fieldset` field.

Changing an entry's blueprint never deletes stored data — fields absent
from the active blueprint are hidden, not erased.

## Field types

`text`, `textarea`, `rich_text`, `number`, `toggle`, `select`, `date`,
`link`, `asset`, `entries`, `terms`, `group`, `repeater`, `flexible`,
`fieldset`, `file` (forms only).

Each field: `handle`, `type`, `label`, `required`, `instructions`,
`conditions` (`{field, operator, value}`), `validation` (extra Laravel
rules), `translatable` (see [multilingual](multilingual.md#which-fields-are-translatable)),
`config` (per-type options).

Repeater rows and flexible blocks each get an optional key and a Show
switch in the editor; templates read keyed items with `->byKey('key')`.

## Entries

- Whole-entity translations: each locale has its own `EntryTranslation`
  (title, slug, data, seo, ready flag, draft/live payloads).
- Drafts edit the `draft` column; publishing copies it to the live
  payload and creates a revision.
- `Draft`/`Ready` per translation controls which locales can be
  requested publicly.
- Slugs are unique per `(collection, locale)` including trashed rows;
  rename + publish leaves a `301` redirect on the old slug.

## Which URL wins

Every collection's entry URL (`route`) and listing URL (`archive_route`),
and every taxonomy's term URL, is a pattern. For each request Sunrice tries
them in this order and stops at the **first pattern that matches**:

1. **Fixed URLs** (no `{slug}`): collection listing pages such as `/blog`
   or `/products`.
2. **Patterns with `{slug}`**, the most specific first: the one with more
   fixed characters wins, so `/blog/category/{slug}` comes before
   `/blog/{slug}`, which comes before `/{slug}`.
3. On a tie (same fixed text), collections before taxonomies, then in the
   order they were created.

The first match is final: when no entry or term has that slug, the page
is a 404 (or a [redirect](#entries) from an old slug). Sunrice doesn't try
the next pattern.

What that means in practice:

| Set up | Visiting | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pages at `/{slug}` with a page whose slug is `blog`, and Articles' listing at `/blog` | `/blog` | The Articles listing. The page can't be reached: rename its slug. |
| Pages at `/{slug}` and Articles at `/blog/{slug}` | `/blog/hello` | The article. `/hello` is a page. |
| Pages at `/{slug}` and a taxonomy's terms at `/{slug}` | `/news` | Only pages are looked up (collections first); give the terms a prefix such as `/topic/{slug}`. |
| Two collections at the same pattern | — | Not allowed: saving the second collection is refused. |

Slugs only have to be unique within a collection and language, so give
listing pages and root-level pages different names, and keep root-level
patterns (`/` or `/{slug}`) to one collection. Fixed URLs in your own
Laravel routes (`routes/web.php`) win over all of these.

## Parent pages

Turn on **Hierarchical** for a collection (Structure → Collections →
Pages & URLs) and each entry gets a **Parent** picker in the editor. A
child's URL starts with its parents' slugs: with the route `/{slug}`,
*Team* under *About* lives at `/about/team`, and *Leaders* under *Team* at
`/about/team/leaders` (up to 10 levels).

- Each language uses its own slugs for the whole path (falling back to the
  main language's, as for single slugs).
- Moving an entry to another parent, or renaming a parent's slug, changes
  the URLs below it; the old addresses redirect (`301`) to the new ones.
- Slugs stay unique per collection and language, so a page is always
  found by its own slug.
- Deleting an entry for good moves its children to the top level.

In templates, `$entry->parent`, `$entry->ancestors()` (top-down, for
breadcrumbs) and `sunrice_entries('pages')->childrenOf($entry)->get()`
(sub-navigation; `childrenOf(null)` for top-level pages).

## Taxonomies

Hierarchical (optional) terms with per-locale `name` + `slug`; terms can
have their own blueprint. `EntryQuery::whereTerm()` optionally includes
child terms.

Attach a taxonomy to collections from either side: the taxonomy form's
**Collections** list or the collection form's **Taxonomies** list (one
taxonomy can serve several collections).

With **Term archive pages** (`has_archive`) on, each term gets a page
listing its entries:

- by default one page per attached collection, at
  `/{collection}/{taxonomy}/{slug}` (e.g. `/blog/category/news`), listing
  only that collection's entries;
- with a `route` (a prefix like `topics` or a pattern like
  `/topics/{slug}`), one page per term across all collections;
- attached to no collection: `/{taxonomy}/{slug}`.

In templates, `$term->url` links to the first collection's page and
`$term->urlIn($collection)` to a specific one.

## Menus

Menus contain nested items of type `entry`, `collection`, `term` or
`url`, with per-locale `labels`. `Sunrice::menu('main')` resolves item
URLs and drops unpublished targets.

## Globals and template parts

`globals` (group `global`) hold site-wide values; `template_parts`
(group `template_part`) hold header/footer-type blocks. Both read via
`Sunrice::global('handle')` / `sunrice_global('handle')`, honoring the
whole-entity fallback.

## Deleting collections and taxonomies

Deleting a collection or taxonomy in the admin doesn't erase its content.
Its entries (or terms) stay in the database but disappear from the admin,
the site, menus, sitemaps and queries.

- **Bring them back:** create a collection (or taxonomy) with the same
  handle. The old one is restored with all its entries or terms, and roles
  keep their permissions for it.
- **Erase them for good:** list what's kept, then purge it on the server:

```bash
php artisan sunrice:orphans                         # list
php artisan sunrice:orphans --purge                 # delete everything listed (asks first)
php artisan sunrice:orphans --purge --handle=news   # only the "news" collection
```

While a deleted collection keeps its handle, no other collection can be
renamed to it. In code, `Entry::withoutGlobalScope(HiddenWithParent::class)`
(and the same on `EntryTranslation`, `Term`, `TermTranslation`) includes
the hidden rows.

## Changing handles

Handles are how templates, code and URLs find a collection, taxonomy,
blueprint or fieldset: template folders (`sunrice/{handle}/…`),
`sunrice_entries('{handle}')`, `whereTerm('{handle}', …)`, fieldset imports
and default URLs. Renaming one doesn't update any of those, so the admin
warns before you save a new handle. Only rename when you'll update every
reference too.
